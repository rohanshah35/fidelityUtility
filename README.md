# fidelityUtility [DEPRECATED]

(Due to UI changes on the website, this doesn't work anymore! Feel free to fork the skeleton code and fix it up. This is a good lesson on the unreliability of web-scraping :/)

This is a webscraping tool for Fidelity.

Everything is run locally, so you are safe inputting your login credentials into the program.

If you are interested in writing your own analysis scripts, make sure to read the instructions in `stats.py`.

I've run these scripts 1000+ times and have never been locked out of my Fidelity account, but if you do end up getting locked out for some reason, it's not my fault.

#### Use at your own risk.
